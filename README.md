# Deferred

This library orchestrates handler functions by chaining them together, converting or serializing data, and managing errors. Its primary focus is making asynchronous code (especially networking code) easier to deal with, but isn't tied to any networking process at all. 

`Deferred` is heavily inspired by Python Twisted's Deferred.
